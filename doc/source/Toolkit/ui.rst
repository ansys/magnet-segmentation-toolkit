After Electronics Desktop is launched, user can assign a multiplier value which is applied to the dimensions of
the geometry selected in the combo box (box or sphere). The user can push the button **Create geometry** and it
creates the selected geometry with a random position and color.

The user can save the project, File>Save project.

The wizard has a progress bar and a logger box, where the user can see the status of every operation.
Red progress bar means the toolkit is busy, and every operation need to wait until the toolkit is released.
